                My choices in life were made by myself, and I believe that we can make our own decisions. The
                reason why I think like that is that I was taught the way, and it is also thanks to my family who
                encourage me to make my own decisions. Thus, I am so grateful to my family for all of its support and
                for teaching me to believe in myself. Additionally, I have to express my love for my teacher of high
                school. She was so nice to my whole class indeed she always encouraged us to make our own choice in
                everything. Also, I believe it is most important in life is to always try to follow your intuitions and
                everything is going to be fine. So, when I am going to face a decision, I always say to myself; I have
                to do it no one can make a decision for me, and even if I am going to deviate from the right path, I
                will never stray from what my heart has decided.</p>
